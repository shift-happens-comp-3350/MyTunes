                        MyTunes provides a clean, modular platform for managing
                        a personal music library with key features designed to
                        enhance usability and organization:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>User Authentication</strong><br />
                            Users can securely sign up, log in, and log out,
                            enabling personalized access to their song library,
                            playlists, ratings, and tags.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Song Library Management</strong><br />
                            Users can add, view, edit, and delete songs by
                            specifying metadata such as title, artist, and
                            genre. All data is saved persistently using an
                            underlying database.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Search Functionality</strong><br />
                            A dynamic search bar allows users to filter songs in
                            real-time by title, artist, genre, or tag. This
                            feature improves navigation and provides quick
                            access to specific content.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Playlist Creation and Organization</strong
                            ><br />
                            Users can create and name custom playlists, add or
                            remove songs, and prevent duplicate entries.
                            Playlists are tied to user accounts and stored
                            persistently.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Song Rating System</strong><br />
                            Songs can be rated from 1 to 5 stars per user,
                            enabling users to sort or prioritize music based on
                            personal preference.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Tagging System</strong><br />

                            "Workout", "Chill", "Throwback") to songs. These
                            tags serve as additional filters and organizational
                            tools, supporting better categorization beyond
                            genres and playlists.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These features together support a complete offline music
                        management workflow with emphasis on usability, clarity,
                        and modularity.
