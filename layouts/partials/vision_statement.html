                        MyTunes is a simple desktop app that helps people listen
                        to, organize, and enjoy their favorite music, completely
                        without needing the internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        MyTunes is made for people who like to keep their music
                        on their own computer and want an easy way to sort and
                        enjoy it. When someone opens MyTunes, they can sign in
                        to their personal account and see their full list of
                        songs right away. The app makes it easy to look through
                        music by typing in the name of the singer, the title of
                        the song, the album, the kind of music, or even a word
                        from the lyrics. People can also make up their own
                        labels—called tags—to help group songs however they
                        like.

                    <p>
                        Users can create playlists by picking songs and giving
                        the list a name, like “Workout Mix” or “Sunday Morning.”
                        Songs in a playlist can be played in order, and tags can
                        be used to gather songs with similar moods or themes.
                        For example, someone might tag songs with “chill,”
                        “party,” or “instrumental” and then look up that tag
                        later to find all the songs that match. These tags work
                        like smart folders that update whenever songs are added
                        or changed.

                        MyTunes is built for music lovers who still enjoy
                        keeping their own music collection, rather than relying
                        on online music services. It’s great for casual
                        listeners who just want something simple and private,
                        collectors who like sorting music their own way, and
                        anyone who doesn’t want their music choices tracked or
                        shared online.

                        All the music, playlists, and user settings in MyTunes
                        are saved on the user's own computer. Nothing is stored
                        online, but each user can still sign in with their own
                        account to keep their music and preferences separate.
                        This means users always have access to their music, even
                        without the internet. It also means no ads, no waiting
                        for songs to load, and no risk of losing access if an
                        online service shuts down.

                    <p>
                        With MyTunes, users are in full control. They can sort
                        music by their own rules, play it their way, and keep
                        everything safe and personal. The app is easy to use and
                        made to fit into everyday life without hassle.

                    <p>
                        We will consider MyTunes a success if it meets the
                        following goals: search results appear quickly and
                        accurately, even for users with large music collections;
                        during a trial period, nearly all users (at least 99 out
                        of 100) can organize and enjoy their music without
                        losing any saved content; and after several weeks of
                        use, a strong majority (at least 85 out of 100) report
                        that the app is easy to use and helps them find their
                        music efficiently.
