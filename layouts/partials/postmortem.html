                    <p>
                        After the Iteration 2 retrospective, our team identified
                        several key areas for improvement that we aimed to
                        address in the final development cycle. One of the most
                        important changes was the adoption of a formal peer code
                        review process. We established a rule that no code could
                        be merged into the main branch without review and
                        approval from at least one other team member. This
                        approach not only helped catch bugs early but also
                        improved code quality and encouraged collaborative
                        problem-solving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also made a conscious decision to narrow the scope of
                        each iteration moving forward. Rather than
                        overcommitting, we limited ourselves to two or three
                        core features per cycle, allowing us to focus on
                        delivering well-tested and fully integrated
                        functionality. This shift in planning helped us manage
                        our time more effectively, especially during a busy
                        academic schedule. Alongside this, we improved our task
                        breakdown process by splitting larger features into
                        smaller, more manageable development tasks. This made it
                        easier to track progress and allowed different members
                        to work in parallel without stepping on each other’s
                        work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another major improvement was our commitment to
                        revisiting and refactoring existing code. We recognized
                        that certain areas of the project—especially those
                        developed quickly in earlier iterations—had accumulated
                        technical debt. In Iteration 3, we used our extra time
                        not only to build new features but also to restructure
                        classes, eliminate redundant logic, and improve method
                        readability across the codebase.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These improvements proved highly effective. The peer
                        review process was followed consistently and resulted in
                        fewer integration issues. Our scoped approach to feature
                        delivery kept the team focused and on track. And the
                        refactoring efforts, though not immediately visible in
                        the user interface, significantly elevated the
                        maintainability and professionalism of the overall
                        project. In retrospect, these changes marked a turning
                        point in our development process and provided a strong
                        foundation for future work, both in this course and
                        beyond.

                    By the end of the project, the app felt solid. We tested everything
                    from logging in to tagging songs, and even tried to break it by doing
                    weird stuff like adding duplicates, leaving fields empty, or clicking
                    things too fast. It all held up. We caught most issues early thanks to
                    peer reviews and everyone keeping an eye on the big picture. We were
                    happy to reach the end without any major bugs slipping through. The app
                    feels stable and complete, and it held up even when we intentionally
                    tried to break it.

                    Wiring up the UI definitely took the longest. Getting scenes to switch properly,
                    keeping controllers talking to each other, and updating tables dynamically took a
                    lot of work. SQLite seemed like it would be the easy part, but integrating it
                    cleanly and handling different user data added more complexity than we expected.
                    On the flip side, the live search feature was a quick win. It came together fast
                    and made the app feel smoother right away. Managing shared state across views?
                    Still kind of a pain.

                    We learned how much smoother things go when everyone’s on the same page. It wasn’t
                    just about dividing work. It was about talking things through, making sure features
                    didn’t clash, and reviewing each other’s code before merging. That “don’t merge without
                    a second pair of eyes” rule saved us more than once. We also got better at catching
                    overlap early and planning out work in smaller chunks. Moving forward, those habits
                    like peer reviews, tight scopes, and better planning are definitely coming with us.
